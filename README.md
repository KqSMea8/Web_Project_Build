# Build Web Project
In this repository , I put the build web project file.

- first folder is gulp only
- secound folder is webpack only (In development)
- third folder is gulp+webpack (In development)

The construction of each folder can be used alone.

## install

```c
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```c
$ npm run dev

$ npm run build
```
